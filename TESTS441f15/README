README

An initial set of tests for the final project cs441 Fall 2015.
The tests are in a tarball linked from the Web page.

For testing the directory structure where you run your tests
should be organized as follows:

	test-cmm2pstack.sh
	cmm2pstack  (or compiler)
  	--- pstack
	--- TESTS441f15

It assumes that there is a subdirectory pstack, a compiler with name 
"cmm2pstack" and a subdirectory TESTS441f15.
So you will need to move "test-cmm2pstack.sh" shell script
from TESTS441f15 (directory created after untarring TESTS44120151201-LAB.tar)
to one level above that directory. Also,
if your complier has a different name, e.g., "compiler",
you need to change to that name the appropriate line
in the shell script).

Finally, your directory for testing should look as follows (see below).
And you may also add your own myTests directory.
With such structure
chmod 755 test-cmm2pstack.sh
./test-cmm2pstack.sh

will run the tests in TESTS44f15 directory.
If you wish to use a similar script for myTests,
the script will need to be adjusted (directory name) and you will 
need to add expected.err and expected.err files for each test.
Those files should be prepared by hand based on truly expected behavior,
and not by running your programs and saving the output (that would only
test if you ran and save output correctly).

2 directories, 34 files

Notes: api/apm/apd are included as a part of TESTS44120151201-LAB.tar
as well as my (not necessarily complete wrt Milestone C) compiler 
"cmm2pststack:, and they should be removed from that directory
before testing.
